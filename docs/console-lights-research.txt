I'm trying to simulate the indicator lights on an IBM 1130 system console.  I need to see a detailed description and layout of these exact lights.  From photographs it appears to be three rectangular groupings.  A large labelled group on the left with 16 lights per row, 6 rows.  A square black unlabelled back lit panel to the right of that and then some more indicator lights in a panel to the right of that.  Can you show me the exact dimension, descriptions, and purpose of each grouping and the indicators within.  Show references: exact pages in documents with exact URLs.

Thought for 4m 26s
You’re trying to simulate the IBM 1130 “blinkenlights” console pedestal and you want:

the exact layout (your “three rectangular groupings” observation),

what each lamp means / why it exists, and

hard references (page-level citations + URLs).

Below is what I can ground in IBM documentation that I could reliably open right now, plus what I couldn’t confirm (notably: some mechanical drawings and some PDFs were intermittently failing with gateway/timeout errors during retrieval).

1) Big left grouping: the 6×(16 positions) “register value” lamps
IBM’s Functional Characteristics manual describes the Console Display Panel as a set of lamp rows where each lamp corresponds to a bit position in a CPU register. 

What the 6 rows are (and why your photos look like 16-per-row)
The manual lists six register displays on the console display panel: 

Instruction Address Register (IAR)

Described as one row of 14 indicator lamps (because only 14 address bits are used). 

In photos, you often still see a 16-position “grid”: physically it’s laid out like 16 columns, but only 14 are meaningful for the address space.

Storage Address Register (SAR)

Also one row of 14 indicator lamps (address bits). 

Storage Buffer Register (SBR)

One row of 16 indicator lamps; reflects data read into core storage for the cycle just completed. 

Arithmetic Factor Register (AFR)

One row of 16 indicator lamps. 

Accumulator (ACC)

One row of 16 indicator lamps (the main arithmetic register). 

Extension (EXT)

(The excerpt I was able to fetch cuts off before EXT’s paragraph, but EXT is shown as part of the console panel diagram and is the classic 1130 pair with ACC for double-length results.) 

The authoritative “layout drawing” for this grouping
IBM includes a diagram of the Console Panel (“Figure 18. Console Panel”) showing the register rows and surrounding indicators. 

URL (document):

IBM 1130 Functional Characteristics (A26-5881-2), Bitsavers PDF: 

The relevant portion begins on the printed page where the heading “CONSOLE DISPLAY PANEL” appears. 

Note: I was able to fetch the page introducing the console display panel and the text that references Figure 18, but fetching the next PDF page image that contains the full Figure 18 drawing intermittently timed out from Bitsavers in this session. I’m therefore citing the text+partial capture and the extracted “Figure 18” block that did come through. 

2) The “right-side indicator panel”: CPU state / cycle / interrupt lamps + mode switch
Your “panel to the right with more indicators” matches what IBM shows in the same console panel diagram: a collection of smaller-labeled lamp fields (not 16-wide rows) that indicate machine phase/state, such as:

instruction/operation sequencing (timing steps like T1/T2/…),

addressing / tag bits,

storage/arithmetic control status,

interrupt level indicators,

cycle control counter indicators,

plus the Mode switch (RUN/SS/SMC/DISP/LOAD/etc.). 

Mode switch detail (“Figure 19. Console Mode Switch”) is explicitly documented with its positions and meaning. 

So architecturally, for your simulator UI, think of this right-side grouping as:

“State telemetry”: lots of single-bit flags that visualize the CPU’s internal control logic, and

“Execution control”: the mode switch (and associated console actions) that let an operator/CE step, display, or load memory.

3) The “middle black square, unlabelled backlit panel”: what it is (and what I can/can’t prove)
You observed: a square black unlabelled backlit panel between the large register lamps and the right-side indicators.

In the sources I could stably open today, I do not have a mechanical/front-panel drawing that labels that middle square as a named assembly (e.g., “lighted logo panel,” “option indicator panel,” etc.). So I can’t honestly claim an “exact purpose” for that square from IBM print documentation with page-level proof in this run.

What I can say, carefully:

IBM’s pedestal panel is described as containing ~150 lamps behind a smoked plexiglass faceplate (consistent with your “big left group + more indicators” observation). 

IBM documentation does refer to back-lighted panel indicators in some 1130-related device/operator docs (wording appears in an IBM 1442 operator-related PDF snippet), implying that backlit panels were used for operator-facing status. 

Working theory (flagged as such): that middle square is likely either

a lighted nameplate/logo window, or

an optional feature/status window depending on model/options,
but I could not retrieve an IBM drawing in this session that labels it unambiguously.

4) Physical dimensions: what’s “exact” from IBM physical planning docs
You asked for exact dimensions of the groupings.

What I can cite exactly (system/console dimensions)
IBM’s Installation Manual – Physical Planning gives overall dimensions for the 1131 CPU cabinet/console assembly. For example (one model family shown):

Width: 88.25 inches

Depth: 29 inches

Height: 46.50 inches 

It also explicitly notes a split between the base and the console height:

“The base of the Processor is 31.50 inches high, the console adds another 13.50 inches for a total height of 45 inches.” 

URL (document):

IBM 1130 Computing System Installation Manual – Physical Planning (A26-5914-3), Bitsavers PDF 

What I cannot cite exactly (panel sub-rectangle dimensions)
I did not locate, in the documents I could successfully open, a dimensioned mechanical drawing that breaks down:

the width/height of the 6×16 register lamp field,

the width/height of the middle square, or

the width/height of the right-side indicator field.

Those usually live in Field Engineering Maintenance/Theory manuals or mechanical prints/parts catalogs; several likely sources were returning 502 Bad Gateway or tool fetch errors during this session, so I couldn’t extract page-accurate measurements for those sub-panels.

5) Practical “simulation UI” mapping (grounded in the docs above)
If you’re building a faithful simulator layout, the most defensible mapping (from IBM’s own functional diagram) is:

Group A — Register bit lamps (your “6 rows × 16 positions”)
Rows: IAR, SAR, SBR, AFR, ACC, EXT

Columns: bit positions (with IAR/SAR effectively using 14 meaningful address bits) 

Group B — CPU state indicators + Mode switch
Mode switch positions documented (RUN, SS, SMC, DISP, LOAD, etc.) 

The rest are “one lamp per internal condition” fields shown in the console panel diagram 

Group C — Middle backlit square
Visually real, but not identified with hard documentary labels from the sources I could open today.

What I recommend next (so you get the missing “exact sub-panel dimensions” with proof)
The missing piece is almost certainly a dimensioned front-panel mechanical drawing (or parts list with drawing numbers). Once you have that, you can nail the exact width/height of each of the three rectangles.

Because some likely manuals were failing to fetch in this session, the fastest path is:

locate a Field Engineering Maintenance Manual (FEMM) or mechanical/parts documentation that includes “console panel” drawings, then I can extract the exact measurements + page references.

In other words: right now I can give you exact meaning/layout of the lamps, and exact overall console dimensions, but not the exact per-rectangle subpanel dimensions from IBM prints—because I couldn’t successfully retrieve the right mechanical document pages in this run.

If you can point me at any one PDF that you know contains the mechanical console/pedestal drawing (even just a URL), I can do the “exact rectangles with exact measurements” part cleanly and cite the exact pages.
